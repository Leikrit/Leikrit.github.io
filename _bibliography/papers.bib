  abstract={Prompt engineering enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform a variety of tasks. However, lengthy prompts significantly increase computational complexity and economic costs. To address this issue, we study six prompt compression methods for LLMs, aiming to reduce prompt length while maintaining LLM response quality. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis covering aspects such as generation performance, model hallucinations, efficacy in multimodal tasks, word omission analysis, and more. We evaluate these methods across 13 datasets, including news, scientific articles, commonsense QA, math QA, long-context QA, and VQA datasets. Our experiments reveal that prompt compression has a greater impact on LLM performance in long contexts compared to short ones. In the Longbench evaluation, moderate compression even enhances LLM performance.},

      abstract={Prompt compression is an innovative method for efficiently condensing input prompts while preserving essential information. To facilitate quick-start services, user-friendly interfaces, and compatibility with common datasets and metrics, we present the Prompt Compression Toolkit (PCToolkit). This toolkit is a unified plug-and-play solution for compressing prompts in Large Language Models (LLMs), featuring cutting-edge prompt compressors, diverse datasets, and metrics for comprehensive performance evaluation. PCToolkit boasts a modular design, allowing for easy integration of new datasets and metrics through portable and user-friendly interfaces. In this paper, we outline the key components and functionalities of PCToolkit. We conducted evaluations of the compressors within PCToolkit across various natural language tasks, including reconstruction, summarization, mathematical problem-solving, question answering, few-shot learning, synthetic tasks, code completion, boolean expressions, multiple choice questions, and lies recognition. },
