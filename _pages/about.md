Hi there! I'm Jerry LI, welcome to my personal website. In here, you can discover something about me.

I am currently an undergraduate student in South China University of Technology. I have visited <a href='https://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/prospective-students/lmh-summer-programmes'>Lady Margaret's Hall, University of Oxford</a> during the summer 2023 and participated in the <a href='https://www.instagram.com/lmhsummerprogrammes?igsh=MTV0ZWM0NHhzdjZpbw=='>AI programme</a>. With great honor, I appeared in the <a href='https://youtu.be/MYwZTulZPLA'>official video</a> posted by LMH.
