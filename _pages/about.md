Hi there! I'm Jerry J. Y. LI, welcome to my personal website. In here, you can discover something about me.

I am currently an undergraduate student in South China University of Technology. I have visited <a href='https://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/prospective-students/lmh-summer-programmes'>Lady Margaret's Hall, University of Oxford</a> during the summer 2023 and participated in the <a href='https://www.instagram.com/lmhsummerprogrammes?igsh=MTV0ZWM0NHhzdjZpbw=='>AI programme</a>. With great pleasure, I appeared in the <a href='https://youtu.be/MYwZTulZPLA'>official video</a> posted by LMH.

I worked as an intern with <a href='https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/WANG-Hao/haowang'>Prof. WANG</a> at <a href='https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/information-hub/artificial-intelligence/'>The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)</a>.

My current research projects include Meta Learning related works. My interests include Computer Vision, Multi-Modaling, Large Language Models and Meta Learning.

Currently, my latest paper is available on ArXiv. Check out <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17411'>PCToolkit: A Unified Plug-and-Play Prompt Compression Toolkit of Large Language Models</a>.

- 2023.7.17 - 2023.8.4

**Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Advanced Applications of Neural Networks and Deep Learning**

**Oxford Grade: 83    Letter Grade: A+**

I learnt a lot about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Specifically, I learnt Generative Models including Auto Regression, Auto Encoder, Variation Auto Encoder, Generative Adversarial Network and Diffusion Model; Reinforcement Learning including DQN, Actor and Critic and DDPG methods; Graph Neural Network including GCN. My tutor <a href="https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ai/people/person/naeemullah-khan">Prof. Khan</a> spoke very well of me.
