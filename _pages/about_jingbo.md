<em> "Aye captain my captain." </em>

I am Jingbo Wang, a third-year undergraduate student at South China University of Technology (SCUT). Currently, I am an intern at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), under the supervision of Haoang Li. I also work closely with Wenxuan Song and Han Zhao, whose guidance and support have been invaluable to my research.
